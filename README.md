# üñºÔ∏è  GAN-CIFAR10

This project was initiated with the aim of delving deep into the realm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by leveraging the CIFAR-10 dataset, which comprises colored images. Our focus lies in exploring a spectrum of GAN architectures, including DCGAN, cDCGAN, SNGAN, and ACGAN, to effectively generate images representing the dataset's ten distinct classes.

Through rigorous experimentation and meticulous analysis, we systematically evaluated the performance of each GAN architecture. Remarkably, our findings indicate that cDCGAN exhibited superior performance compared to the other models tested. Notably, cDCGAN not only demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality images but also achieved the best FID scores among all the architectures assessed.

Moreover, beyond the quantitative metrics, our exploration delved into qualitative aspects, scrutinizing the visual fidelity and diversity of the generated images across different GAN architectures. This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of various GAN architectures in the context of image generation tasks, thereby contributing to the advancement of generative modeling techniques.
